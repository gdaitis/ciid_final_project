##Interview with Ankkit
[Ankkit](http://ciid.dk/education/management/ankkit-modi/) is a teaching assistant and lecturer at CIID. He has been involved with cryptocurrencies from very early on, thus interviewing him to gain basic knowledge on the topic was a no-brainer.

There are two whitepapers that will become laws in EU since Jan 2018 in regards to cryptrocurrencies and how they should be regulated:

* GDPR
* PSD2

Before buying coins of any ICO, one must ask:

* Who is mining the coins? (Who is creating the value?)
* What is your reward for transaction?
* What can I do with the coin?
* How many coins are there?
* What happens when all of the coins are mined?
