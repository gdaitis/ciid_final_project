# Focusing on a concept

*2017.10.11*

I've met with more clever people (Stiven and John), and below are my notes.

## Random thoughts

- Choose and organization to ground the idea on.
- What is the part I am going to design?
	- The interaction experience, once the system exists
- What problem am I solving?
	- What's the story?
	- Get the narrative right.
- Once the problem is identified, every decision that I make is going to be about communicating the solution to the problem. Is what I am doing is getting closer to **communicating that solution**?
	- UI vs programming (there's less value in actually building vs. visually communicating)
	- etc.
- What kind of statement about the problem would I be proud of saying at the presentation? What I was proud of *trying* to solve?
- There has to be a clear impact that I'd be making.
- Saying that solution is about CIID may be risky due to the fact, that it may conflict with others' perception of what CIID is. Thus, talk about education institutions, VCs, corporations, etc. It's not about CIID, but a thing that CIID could be part of.
- Try to build a story out of building blocks, and iterate it. Solve the narrative.
- Design deliverables:
	- Workflow schema
	- UI/UX sketches/prototypes

## Narrative points (random order)

- Planting the problem: "Today, students come to CIID and pay tuition fee. Then, they are pushed out of the door, after they're done. But this person does not want to be an employee, and she doesn't want to be an entrepreneur too. She wants to stay close to the CIID network, even throughout her career in her later life." 
- Then, specifically poking the issues at the problem, which are the ones I'm trying to resolve.
- Fast forward 2 years, when the solution is finally working. Demonstrate that state of it.
- Couple of pieces in the concept have to be the "A-ha" moment.
- A new way to fund ideas and to create another channel for the individuals behind these ideas to take them further.
- Fancy words:
	- Like crowdfunding
	- Blockchain
	- Smart contracts
	- Ethereum
- Solving the documentation problem: we need to further incentivise the documentation of ideas. Why? Because the value created at CIID is not being captured in a way that is accessible for society, investors, everybody.
- The incentive to document your project is that is goes through this "machine" workflow
- Data for story: how many projects are being developed in design schools?
- [Design Schools, organizations, etc] -> ??? (my design) -> Opensource, angels, funds, etc.
- Curated by creative techs, designers, investors, people who know their stuff, thus the idea, which goes through, has this 'guarantee' on it. Not random.
- Transparency is core feature
- VIP kickstarter, leveraging the uniqueness of the network of the organization
- There's no innovation funnel, the water is not moving.
- Water as analogy.
- Started with the documentation problem, but when solving that problem, I also solved the VC, value capturing problem. Things changed.

	- how could it potentially change situation when navigating from being a student to work/entrepreneur <- I don't want these two options, I want something else! **That may be the problem story I am trying to solve.**
- [Curve that every narrative should have.]
- Problem (3 mins) -> solutions (x mins) -> ... -> enthusiasm -> end

## Concept points (random order)

- My focus is the idea collection.
- Idea -> discussion about the idea.
- Every idea generated has to go through the platform
- Platform -> process, workflow
- List of ideas / bulletin board
- Calendar
- Live feed of what's currently happening
- Following the students
- Hashtags / keywords / categories
- Donate tokens
- Funnels towards output / deployment channels: kickstarter, impact investors, opensource
- Database of discussions
- Curated by creative techs, designers, investors, people who know their stuff, thus the idea, which goes through, has this 'guarantee' on it. Not random.
- Chain of discussions on an idea, timeline, that forks, relative to the feedback.
- It could be a company that provides this as service
- Could be coin-based: voting, access to system. VC's: buy coin, invest it to ideas (put on project)
- URL of the project page: sponsored by X fund
- Would be nice to do smthn. with blockchain to have monetary transaction. Can't ignore the business model.
- Transparency is core feature
- My profile feature (as portfolio, that you're building)
