# Meet with Stiven (again)

In CIID, all the value, the relationships, are not captured, documented. 

There is no formal way to reignite the connection with the alumnis, other than the traditional methods (become a teacher, be hired, etc.).

The opportunity is in the fact that in CIID we have a close, unique network, so, how do we create a system / method / tool that can support in enabling the potential that exists in such network?

The way that the value is created is because enough people believe in that story, that's not new.

Close offers may be a way to go, where a certain group of investors have access, later it may open up to more people.

The key of decentralization, is that if you want to trust something, instead of looking at one entity that is providing the trust, the trust is coming from all of the nodes in the network - a sense of security in the masses.

CIID: if you start participating, and there is value in what you are doing, and people are reacting, then you are part of the network. There are similarities in how CIID organically operates, and what this [blockchain] technology can enable. Can we leverage that?

Could it eventually be an alternative to being an employee? Entrepreneur? Could I play whatever role that is appropriate for me to play? But at the same time, there would be some sort of formal way to measure my contribution, my participation, my place as a node in that network?

Why don't we make it easy for people interested to invest in CIID? Why don't we create a CIID fund, that could invest in some final projects that have some real potential to make a difference, grow, scale? How do we make it easier for people who want to contribute their knowledge, time, capital back to CIID?

Cryptocurrencies and FIAT currencies are not that different, the only difference is that where the trust comes from: a government, a network, a private person? It's a paradigm shift in your head, not a technical thing.
