# Review #1

*2017.10.04.*

## Short summary
I've met with [Tobias](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobiastoft/), [Blair](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blair-johnsrude-43151854/) and [Calle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nordenskjold/) so they could give their opinions on my direction and the concepts of systems I have proposed. In short, the discussion was extremely professional (which I did not expect), very useful and interesting. They did not give me ideas; instead, they gave me questions to ask myself. One of the most important ones (also, one of the most obvious) - **what is the value for the end user?** It's kind of crazy that me trying to run away from engineer mindset, where focusing on technology blinds you from the purpose of it, let me exactly to that. However, the guys did not discourage me, provided me with some good guidance and I felt optimistic and ready to move towards the direction I have set myself.

Below are short notes from the review session.

## Notes from the session
- Will there still be a notion of team hierarchy (creative director, etc.)?
- Is this the process where the client is voting on the ideas?
- Part of what is nice in being in a design organization is that you don't have to think about business. Freelancers quite often talk about narrow margins affecting their creativity. How could we still maintain the insulation feeling?
- Start looking from a perspective of a classical model of an agency
- Complex systems that work are the product of evolution of a simple system that worked. Trying to conceive a complex system will result in a system that collapses.
- How could we simplify the system so that we could scale it later?
- Can you test this at a small scale?
- How do you get to a level of complexity you are proposing without imposing it? A board game? Other simple simulation? 
- What are the bare elements of the dynamics of the system?
- Series of simple experiments that become more complicated over time.
- You don't want to have a complex model with complicated concepts which you have to explain to people.
	- Rasin excercise
	- Mocking some UIs
	- Game where win/lose
	- Rewards/incentive 
- **The risk is building an extremely complicated system that does not really generate any value for the people.**
- What pieces of design process can we quantitatively measure to be more valuable than others?
- Talk to people who value having a boss.
- Why is this system based around designers and not other people?
- There is something interesting in getting to know people in terms of what are they doing really well so that in the end you could construct hyper effective teams from such people.
- Could we model a million designers and their behaviour in the teams?
- Make something and see if it makes sense.

> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system. â€“ John Gall
