# Review #1

*2017.10.04.*

## Short summary
I've met with [Tobias](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobiastoft/), [Blair](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blair-johnsrude-43151854/) and [Calle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nordenskjold/) so they could give their opinions on my direction and the concepts of systems I have proposed. In short, the discussion was extremely professional (which I did not expect), very useful and interesting. They did not give me ideas; instead, they gave me questions to ask myself. One of the most important ones (also, one of the most obvious) - **what is the value for the end user?** It's kind of crazy that me trying to run away from engineer mindset, where focusing on technology blinds you from the purpose of it, let me exactly to that. However, the guys did not discourage me, provided me with some good guidance and I felt optimistic and ready to move towards the direction I have set myself.

Below are short notes from the review session.
