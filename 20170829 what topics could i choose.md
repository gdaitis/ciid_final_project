# What topics could I choose?

*2017.08.29*

I want my final project be a transformative experience in terms of both personal and professional lives. Also, I believe, it is a unique opportunity to express myself as a problem solver, double check where my strengths and weaknesses are, and improve on those weaknesses. I strongly believe this will be a great challenge of keeping focused, staying in the zone for as long as possible, managing ambiguity, self-doubt and confidence. 

I feel like approaching the final project in terms of the tools or deliverables I would prefer is dangerous, since it may lead towards trying to rationalize the decision towards, for example, a certain technology – a very easy path for a person with an engineering background to choose. Thus, I believe in choosing a topic or an audience first.

In terms of a topic, I have been recently fascinated by **finance, more specifically – investments and valuations of companies, start-ups and other organizations**. However, I see the danger of such technically loaded topic, where I may not have sufficient knowledge to proceed in designing a solution for a problem in the field.

Another topic I am interested in is **consumption of media: news, articles, music**. I am fascinated by how streaming services have changed the way we consume music and how artists tend to release their songs, or how big news agencies are changing their business models from advertisement to subscription based content delivery, making us, the consumers of news media, appreciate the articles more. Such processes of change are extremely interesting because they are happening on a holistic scale, affecting many stakeholders and ecosystems.

A different way of looking for design opportunities is by focusing on certain groups of people that I may have access to. **Copenhagen is quite famous for its startup community; thus I would also be interested in talking with them** to find out what kinds of challenges they face as young businesses struggling to get on their own feet.

As mentioned above, I believe that the correct way to start the project is by either selecting a target group of people and proceeding to find a design opportunity (in my case – startup communities of Copenhagen), or by choosing a certain topic. The latter option is the one that gives more comfort initially, since it is pleasant to think about the areas one would like to work in; however, they may become hardly feasible to approach in terms of logistics. In this case, I would like to start out by finding people who would be able to inform me more on the topics of personal finance, fintech, investment, media consumption, etc.

The first action I will be taking during the days that follow will be connecting with as many experts as possible in order to figure out specific opportunity areas that would be both interesting to me and technically/logistically feasible.

The skills that I believe I could rely on are more production oriented: programming, electronics, photography, filming. However, while being comfortable in certain mediums, I believe I have little to no experience in running a project from the beginning to the end by myself. In addition to that, I believe that I would to challenge myself in storytelling capabilities, both visual and verbal.

GUI classes have been one of my favorites during the IDP experience, and I would love to incorporate the knowledge of the process and the acquired skills during the journey of my final project. However, I am extremely cautious of not getting stuck on certain form/medium in terms of final deliverable, so I understand that I may as well not use that knowledge at all.
