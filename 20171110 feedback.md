# Responses from the mechanics inquiry

**Part 1:** *“Once initiated, every project has a finite amount of tokens that act as shares of the project. In the beginning, the 100% of tokens belong to the initial Founder(s), but they could be transferred to any other person in the platform, used as currency to pay to Professionals, or sold to Investors.”*

I got a bit confused between tokens and ETH when I first read this because you referred to tokens as a form of currency. Maybe some explanation of the difference between tokens and ETH and how one can be converted into another could be useful?
 
**Part 2:** *“The truth is, however, that early projects rarely have any budget, and for some of the Professionals shares may not be an interesting option. Thus, a smart contract can be signed in such way that would make a payment to the Professional’s account once there is any money in the budget of the project. In such way, professionals are given a promise by a smart contract that they would be paid if there is any income into the project’s budget.”*

So a smart contract is an agreement that says:
-Professional will perform (x) work for Founder
-Founder will give the Professional either (1) tokens or (2) ETH if (x) work is accepted

Is this understanding correct? I think drawing it out in a diagram would help make it clearer. In fact, I think what would be useful is a set of definitions at the beginning of the document, especially for people who are not familiar with how cryptocurrency works.

**Part 3:** *“If for some reason there is a disagreement between a professional and a founder (for example, the founder does not mark the task as done for the professional), one can create a dispute, that would be voted on publicly by the overall community in the platform.”*

I’m not sure if this is the best way to resolve a disagreement. There might be some imbalance of power in the overall community that might skew the vote one way. How do you ensure that there is a balance between the number of professionals/founders in the community or that they won’t get paid to vote in a certain way, etc? Maybe explore other forms of dispute resolution (independent third party?) and other ways people resolve shareholder disagreements?

**Part 4:** *“Founders can issue some of the shares (tokens) for an internal sale within the platform. In such way, people having access to the system, can buy (invest) the shares (tokens) from the founders, and the income from that sale would fulfil some (or all, depending on the amount of money received from the sale) of the smart contracts signed with the professionals, if any were signed.”*

Who is this internal sale open to?

*“Founders can also initiate public sale of the shares of the company (so called ICO, an Initial Coin Offering), thus leaving the closed system of the platform.”*

What is an Initial Coin Offering? Is it the same as an IPO?

**Part 5:**

In summary, what I think could be helpful:

- Create a definition section for all these terms
- Draw diagrams to show how each part works
- Think about other dispute resolution mechanisms
- Is the role of the investor important? There wasn’t much mention of this role
- Maybe as an artefact for your concept you can prepare some sample contracts?

**First thought:**
This needs some visualisation with diagrams showing the flow or relationships between the actors. This could be a big part of the interface?

**Actors:**
Great! This is really clear.

**Incentives:**
Also very clear! Designers can get jobs, founders can find people who will help them develop their project, and investors can find investments opportunities! All facilitated securely by the system!

**Tokens:**
Yep. Very clear.

**Smart contracts:**
This is just a regular contract? But thats good! 

I feel that this is the real value of you system. There are lots of platforms for matching designers, founders or investors. But they leave it to the users to handle the process themselves. With this system I would get all the benefits from AngelList or other networks, but added security and facilitation.

The part of payment after the project has a budget is really smart. I feel this makes me want to work on projects that I believe have potential, and feel safe that I will get something for the value I add.

The dispute part is hard. I see how community voting would solve it in theory. But this adds group dynamics to the equation. Could someone trick this system?

(In Leonardo Da Vinci’s biography there is a story where his father arranges a project for him. But Leonardo is know for not finishing his work, so his father adds lots of extra terms to the contract to incentivise Leonardo to finish on time and to the clients wishes. Like time restriction for the intervals of the project, but also added bonuses if he finished on time. Through Leonardos career he has lots of unfinished projects and lots of disputes with clients. Sometimes they take him to court. And most of the times the client win.)

**Sales of Tokens:**
This feels like a natural added benefit of the security of the contracts.

There is something really interesting of how you describe the ICO as the point of leaving the system. It feels really organic.

**Ideas:**
What if you slightly gamify the contracts with different bonuses like “Happy-Client-Bonus”, “Good-Dialog-Bonus” or “Extra-Hours-Bonus”?
