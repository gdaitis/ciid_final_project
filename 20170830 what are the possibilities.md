# What are the possibilities in the topics?

*2017.08.30*

## Interview with Iskra

Today, I've talked to [Iskra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iskra-u%C5%A1%C4%87umli%C4%87-a8529b42/), my pen pal from the last year of IDP. We caught up just to chat about what directions I'd like to take and to hear what she thinks about them, since she has gone through the process herself. She immediately got excited about media and music, since that field already was starting to give her ideas, if she would be doing the final project again on her own. Her colleague also joined the casual chat, so here are the several things I've took notes on.

### News media

* [Politifact.com](http://www.politifact.com/) - a site that was fact-checking since 2008 American election - way before it was cool.
	* **Staff of editors** would select the topics
	* **Miners** would act as fact-checkers
* [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/?utm_term=.3dad8de10992) has an initiative that is called **Pinocchio**, they do similar stuff.
* [Media Sifter](http://www.mediasifter.co/), run by CIID Alumni [John Ferreira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnfwferreira) is a startup that is trying to solve the news bias problem b y using **Blockchain** technology.

### Finance

* [N26](https://next.n26.com/en-eu/) is a mobile bank that a lot of CIID Alumni work at - may be an interesting thing to research/interview.
* [Dario Buzzini](https://it.linkedin.com/in/dariobuzzini) has worked with an Italian bank.
* [Twitch Users Are Playing the Stock Market With $50K of One Dude's Money](http://gizmodo.com/twitch-users-are-playing-the-stock-market-with-50k-of-1795674617)
* [Cleo, an intelligent assistant for your money.](https://meetcleo.com/)
* **What is personal finances were completely transparent?**

### Media

* Christiania has a nice underground music scene
* [Cyrus](http://ciid.dk/education/portfolio/idp16/students/cyrus-kamath/) from IDP16 is a resident artist in Christiania.
* **How would media look if we had no boundaries? If we had no accountability? What if everything is being accounted for?**


### A few general takeaways:

* Ask yourself - **what problems I would like to solve?**
* Observe the **behaviours** - they may lead towards areas of possibilities.
* Check for areas where there is a **lack of interaction**.
* Ask yourself stupid questions: **what if....?**

## What would be the opportunity areas?

After the interview, I took some time to try to think about what could be the major problems and opportunity areas that I could explore more within (one of) these three topics.

### News

* In her [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/lara_setrakian_3_ways_to_fix_a_broken_news_industry#t-334505) *Lara Setrakian* proposes three ways to fix news industry:
	1. We need news that's built on deep domain knowledge
	2. We need a kind of Hippocratic oath for the news industry
	3. We need to embrace complexity in order to make sense of our world

### Music

* How might we discover quality music from independent artists?
* How might we make good independent artists seen / popular?

### Investing

* How might we educate people on investing?
* How might we educate people on correctly evaluating investment opportunities?

## Interview with Stiven

[Stiven Kerestegian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stivenk/) is Head of Innovation and Strategy at CIID, he spends most of his time at [CIID Consulting](http://ciidconsulting.dk/). I've spent an hour with him talking about the ways I could approach my final project, and he was one of the first people to steer me towards a more concrete direction. Here are some points from the discussion we had.

### Motivations on selecting certain topics for final project

1. Your final project has some very specific purpose (e.g. *I want to work at XXX* or *I want to have a portfolio piece that XXX*)
2. This is you core passion - something that you love deeply doing
3. Identifying something that is actionable, meaning - possible to act on even after graduating CIID.

The project should cover at least one of these motivations.

### Problem: value created at CIID is not being captured

CIID is a place that generates a lot of value. It's students, after leaving the faculty, work at best design firms; CIID's network reaches world's top companies and institutions. However, the only way for CIID to capture some of that value is either by having people from the network to come and teach or consult. However, the only incentive for alumni to do this is an emotional one, not practical, and, with time, practicality takes over.

>"It is getting harder to justify my time that I'm donating [for CIID]".

There are a lot of purpose/impact investors showing up at CIID, wanting to invest in this place since they understand the value it creates. However, due to the current evaluation models, CIID's monetary value is not huge due to little cash flow they generate.

>"The model of evaluating CIID is not compatible with the value CIID creates"

Thus, how can we capture more of this value? What would be the ideal scenario for alumni after graduating CIID in terms of maintaining the relationship?

>"How do I make this place so attractive that nobody wants to leave?"

Cryptocurrencies and technologies around them could be one of the ways that could lead towards a potential solution of such problem. 

What if CIID made an ICO, and everybody, who graduated, received a token - CIID coin, that has certain value in the market of cryptocurrencies. Alumni would become "board members" of CIID, interested in maintaining and increasing the value of the organisation, since now it would be part of their capital. What if alumni would be rewarded in additional coins for teaching / consulting? What if the role of CIID consulting, instead of being a consultancy, would become a platform for an exclusive group of designers, who would be owning a little part of that network?

Such business model, minus cryptocurrencies, exists as **coop organisation**. [REI](https://www.rei.com/) is an example of that: people pay subscription fee to be able to shop at REI, but in return, they are rewarded with the profits of whole organisation at the end of the year. **The company is owned by its customers**.

## Interview with Calle

[Calle Nordenskjold](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nordenskjold/) works as Senior Industrial Designer, as is also my advisor during the Final Project period.

Let's zoom out a little bit, since it is way too risky to jump into execution phase being so early in the process. Thus, Calle recommends to start with mapping out all the stakeholders that would be involved in the investor - startup relationship. **Let's have a design centred approach towards design.**

* How do players in the system get in touch with each other?
* How do I contact investors? What are their problems?
* How do investors approach startups?
* What are different motivations of players in the whole system?
* What are different types of investors?
* How do relationships between different stakeholders in a venture work?
* Why does crowdfunding (not) work?
* Information as currency: give up info for investment opportunity?
* Crowdfunding: pre-sale vs. investment?
* Emotion vs. investment?
