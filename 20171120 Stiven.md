# Storytelling advice from Stiven

Anatomy of the contract (explain parts of the contract, how it is composed).

When entering the platform, the projects start at a certain fidelity. (whitepaper model, friday project deliverables in CIID)

Platform of Closed communities (like Slack).

Differentiating factors: 

- There's a filter - not anybody joining the network/system.
- Competitor analysis (STEAL THE VIDEO IDEAS FROM THEM!!!):
	- Colony
	- Soren's fund
	- AngelList
	- 21.co
	- Quirky (literally what i'm doing, w/o smart contracts, failed - why?)
	- 99 designs
	- Other freelance platforms?
- Blockchain/smart contracts (back-end)
	- Get rid of central controlling party (would be owned by a company in SF, but now we don't have to have it)
	- Trust is provided by every node in the network, not a central company.
	- Contracts: 20% thing
- How budgets work (equity vs. ETH)

Investing model: hybrid. Pre-ICO only available to your network. (trying to avoid the bad things about icos). **Make comparisons to current models.** Ico funds example (Soren's company).

You could be an independent professional.

Onboarding:

- ETH is a thing (**maybe bitcoin instead of eth?**)
- Wallet (explain how to get it) (Analogy: PayPal)
- UI: step 1, step 2, step 3...

Bitcoin and ETH raised in value 3x since I've started the project.

One person as a character, from the perspective of a contributor.

There is no EASY way to take ideas further beyond "friday phase"

Open-source (**existing successful example?**): networks roll out their own versions: stanford, ciid, RCA, 10 cool friends, etc.

MONEY - ETH/BTC - TOKENS: create analogies to real world.

**WHY**: "I don't want to be an employee nor an entrepreneur. I want to spend my time doing a bunch of different projects and putting my bets on a bunch of different things, and learn at the same time. I've just graduated, I've got job offers, and maybe I could do my own company, but neither of these things really appeal to me. I wish there was another alternative. And here I have discovered BITES - I don't have to be an employee anymore!" ----> UI: "so I get to the URL, i sign up, i see all these projects in need of the skills I'm really good at, and I start participating" ----> the competition is there, since the market is growing. Why? Because people are not okay with choosing just red/blue pill. BITES is serving that market.
