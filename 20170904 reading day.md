	* In oder to use it, you don't actually have to understand how cryptocurrencies work. There are already some solutions to make this user-friendly.
	* Ledge explanation example: paying for lunch between friends - exchanging cash every time is not convenient, so you create a list (ledger) that is public and has history of payments.
	* The **history of transactions IS the currency**

##Estonia could offer ‘estcoins’ to e-residents

* Fortunately, the secure digital identities used by e-residents (as well as citizens and residents of Estonia) are now the ideal mechanism for securely trading crypto assets in a trusted and transparent digital environment. The tokens can not be counterfeited and the government oversight means they can not be used for illegal activities.
* ...people do already talk about ‘investing in a country’, but what they really mean is investing in opportunities related to that country — such as companies, property or bonds. [...]
We already know that many people become e-residents simply because they are fans of our country, our technology and our ideas, and being an e-resident enables them to show their support.
A government-supported ICO would give more people a bigger stake in the future of our country and provide not just investment, but also more expertise and ideas to help us grow exponentially.
* In time, estcoins could also be accepted as payment for both public and private services and eventually function as a viable currency used globally. By using our APIs, companies and even other countries could accept these same tokens as payment. It will also be possible to build more functions on top of the estcoins and use them for more purposes, such as smart contracts and notary services.

##THE INITIAL COIN OFFERING, THE BITCOIN-Y STOCK THAT'S NOT STOCK—BUT DEFINITELY A BIG DEAL

* Yes, they call it an ICO, and over the last 14 months, more than 60 startups, open source projects, and ragtag online communities used this method to raise over $250 million for their own business efforts.

##Citi Speaks: State-Backed Cryptocurrency Key to Blockchain Adoption

* While cryptocurrencies have so far only been issued via decentralized blockchain protocols and in private corporate pre-sales, she argued that a central bank issuance would not only enhance the liquidity of new assets, but also give rise to entirely new markets.

##Should You Do an ICO?
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8iOuEzFrrk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8iOuEzFrrk)

* Does the actual token have a utility? Does your company fall apart without this token?
* It is very difficult to find talent in the blockchain field: can you technologically sustain your business?
* Security: where are you holding your private keys? Who is holding them? Which wallet provider?
* If you have an ICO, you are a red target for hackers, automatically.
* If your business model is speculation - you are on a downward spiral.
* "Always ask yourself a question: what are people hiring you for?"

##Why Blockchain Needs Design
[https://www.fastcodesign.com/90136657/why-blockchain-needs-designers](https://www.fastcodesign.com/90136657/why-blockchain-needs-designers)

* As blockchain makes its way into the mainstream, it will be up to designers to temper its technical complexity with usability–in short, blockchain will need interfaces. IBM is in the early stages of creating them.
* But while blockchain collects all that information in one place, and ensures that everything is accurate, it doesn’t make parsing or organizing that information very easy. That’s Sukaviriya and her team’s job–to highlight the relevant information to the right person when they need it. “I don’t think that blockchain is what the users have in mind really,” Sukaviriya says. “They don’t really understand at the deep level what it will do. But what is important is the ability to get to the information that they can trust.”

##The Bitcoin Model for Crowdfunding
[https://startupboy.com/2014/03/09/the-bitcoin-model-for-crowdfunding/](https://startupboy.com/2014/03/09/the-bitcoin-model-for-crowdfunding/)

* The Bitcoin model for crowdfunding dispenses with everything except the software:
	* Write software to power a completely distributed network in which any node can participate anonymously.
	* Allocate scarce resources in the network using a scarce token – an “Appcoin”. Users need this Appcoin to use the network. Owners of scarce resources get paid in Appcoins.
	* Pre-mine or early-mine Appcoins and keep some non-threatening amount. These are shares of your company, equity that will appreciate in value if the network is adopted.
	* Give network operators the ability to collect new Appcoins in proportion to their contribution. Route a small fraction of each transaction output to the developer foundation (Mastercoin does this). These revenues are used to pay for operations, and bounties for ongoing development.
	* As network usage increases, so does equity value and revenue. 
	* Anyone can buy Appcoins, anywhere, anytime, anonymously. Ship your code, ring the IPO bell.

##Certificates, Reputation, and the Blockchain
[https://medium.com/mit-media-lab/certificates-reputation-and-the-blockchain-aee03622426f](https://medium.com/mit-media-lab/certificates-reputation-and-the-blockchain-aee03622426f)

* Using the blockchain and strong cryptography, it is now possible to create a certification infrastructure that puts us in control of the full record of our achievements and accomplishments. It will allow us to share a digital degree with an employer while giving the employer complete trust that the degree was in fact issued to the person presenting it.
* In fact you can think of reputation as a type of currency for social capital, rather than financial capital.
* Issuing a certificate is relatively simple: we create a digital file that contains some basic information such as the name of the recipient, the name of the issuer (MIT Media Lab), an issue date, etc. We then sign the contents of the certificate using a private key to which only the Media Lab has access, and append that signature to the certificate itself. Next we create a hash, which is a short string that can be used to verify that nobody has tampered with the content of the certificate. And finally we use our private key again to create a record on the Bitcoin blockchain that states we issued a certain certificate to a certain person on a certain date. Our system makes it possible to verify who a certificate was issued to, by whom, and validate the content of the certificate itself.

##Blockchain Tokens and the dawn of the Decentralized Business Model
[https://blog.coinbase.com/app-coins-and-the-dawn-of-the-decentralized-business-model-8b8c951e734f](https://blog.coinbase.com/app-coins-and-the-dawn-of-the-decentralized-business-model-8b8c951e734f)

* ...There are a few key components to these tokens:
	* They are the currency that is used in the app itself.
	* Contributors to the app are directly paid for their contributions in tokens. This can be extremely granular.
	* The tokens are easily converted to any local currency since they are on the blockchain.
* ...it is about an entirely new business model that is being created and tried for the first time: a decentralized business model
* You’ll notice one other thing about these “projects” or “apps”: they are really decentralized software protocols.
* Historically it has been difficult to incentivize the creation of new protocols
* Now someone can create a protocol, create a tokens that is native to that protocol, and retain some of that token for themselves and for future development. **This is a great way to incentivize creators: if the protocol is successful, the token will go up in value.**
* You give people partial ownership of the network. Just like equity in a startup, it is more valuable to join the network early because you get more ownership. Decentralized applications do this by paying their contributors in their token. And there is potential for that token (partial ownership of the network) to be worth more in the future. **This is equivalent to being a miner in the early days of Bitcoin.**
* The growth in the number of tokens is likely to mimic the growth of apps in the App Store: it will start slow and then grow exponentially.![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*s9NVCWOtcQGb5355.)

##How to Raise Money on a Blockchain with a Token
[https://blog.gdax.com/how-to-raise-money-on-a-blockchain-with-a-token-510562c9cdfa](https://blog.gdax.com/how-to-raise-money-on-a-blockchain-with-a-token-510562c9cdfa)

* How do we identify the network effect in our project?
	* In some projects the network effect and token model is obvious. For example, the network effect of Uber is the growing network of riders and drivers. So the token model for a Decentralized Uber and dUberCoin is pretty straight forward: make dUberCoin the native token of the Decentralized Uber network and reward early riders and drivers with more of it at the start
	* It’s important to recognize what the network (or networks!) within your project are.
