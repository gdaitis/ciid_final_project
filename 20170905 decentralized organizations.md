##The Future of Organization

* But as the number of participants expands, the “tribe-level” of organization begins to fail. There is too much information for everyone to keep track of all at once and this gives rise to the whole suite of collective action and “tragedy of the commons” problems studied in academics. Consensus decison-making becomes increasingly burdensome and tribal instincts begin to break the organization into several often-competing sub-tribes rather than a smoothly unified whole.
* Up until very recently, the only consistently successful resolution to this problem has been some flavor of a centralized hierarchical control organization.
* The state-of-the art of the blockchain today, built by Ethereum, is much more than that. It takes the blockchain beyond a decentralized database, to enable decentralized execution. In effect, it is a public computer which is literally being run by the commons, for the commons.
* ...efforts are underway, notably at Backfeed.cc, to generalize a game theoretic protocol for motivating and aligning interests. Such a protocol should satisfy a few basic requirements:
	* **Distributed governance** — There should be no centralized evaluation and reward distribution. The protocol should be able to operate in a decentralized peer-to-peer network, in a way that ensures accountability and auditability.
	* **Scalability** — The protocol should support the operations of a variety of decentralized collaborations, regardless of their nature, objectives, and size. The protocol must enable scale-free organizations that can grow from a handful of individuals to hundreds, thousands, or millions of people, and if needed, also shrink back to any desirable size with no adverse effects.
	* **Resilience** — The protocol should sustain any potential operational failure, fraudulent activities, or malicious attack.
	* **Incentive for beneficial collaboration** — The protocol should provide agents with incentives to contribute to the DCO. The protocol motivates participation by ensuring that agents will be rewarded with “tokens” as well as with a reputation score according to the community’s evaluation of their respective contributions. The protocol also motivates agents to evaluate genuinely each other’s contributions by ensuring that agents reputation in the DCO will be adjusted, upward or downward, according to the quality of their respective evaluations.
	* **Internal alignment** — The protocol should promote the alignment of agents within the DCO. The reputation scoring mechanism must be designed to enhance the reputation (and thus the impact) of agents that further the interests of the community. By adjusting the reputation according to the quality of evaluations, the agents whose evaluations are the most aligned with the community’s values acquire a stronger level of influence within the DCO’s evaluation system.
	* **Diversification** — In addition to encouraging the internal alignment of agents within a DCO, the protocol should also encourage diversification at the external level, by facilitating the exploration of alternatives features (e.g. spin-offs or ‘forks’), which might prove to be the most suitable to a particular context.

##Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Explained

* Pros:
	* No wastage of funds - every stakeholder can participate in the voting process. Funds are not allocated by personal goals - you have to convince whole community
	* Transparency, allows you to verify what's going on
* Cons:
	* Transparency may lead to the lack of competitive advantage: no secret plans. Open source example: anyone can fork your competitive advantage.
	* Cutting the leadership off may be an issue: not every stakeholder want to manage the company, some of them just want to trust the leadership.

##An Ethereum Platform For Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, Jack du Rose, Colony

* Jack du Rose is cofounder of Colony, an Ethereum platform for decentralised organisations. Colony seeks to make building an organisation online as easy as creating a Facebook group by allowing people from all over the world to collaborate on projects without the need for formal hierarchy or trust.

##Colony Moves Organizations, Companies onto the Ethereum Blockchain

* Think of Colony as the merger of Trello and Upwork, but running on a blockchain. Colony essentially brings the organization and human capital together onto a decentralized and transparent platform, and adds a monetary system that rewards freelancers and contributors alike based on their contributions to the success of the organization.

##What is the Difference Between Public and Permissioned Blockchains?

* A blockchain developer may choose to make the system of record available for everyone to read, but they may not wish to allow anyone to be a node, serving the network’s security, transaction verification or mining. It’s a mix-and-match situation that is reflected in the various ways entrepreneurs are experimenting with the technology.

##Understanding Semi-private Blockchain Applications
[https://medium.com/@wmougayar/understanding-semi-private-blockchain-applications-6bbe91fc3596](https://medium.com/@wmougayar/understanding-semi-private-blockchain-applications-6bbe91fc3596)

* In contrast to public chain applications where anyone can participate, and private chain applications (consortium or not) where participants are tightly managed, semi-private chain-based applications are run by a single company who grants access to any user who qualifies, and they typically target business-to-business users.

##CphEthereum Slack channel
So, I've joined CphEthereum channel and has a short conversation:

##Interview with Aram Armstrong
Aram Armstrong is our Final Project supervisor, helping us to navigate the process. I had a short interview with him today, and here are several random notes from the conversation we had.

* Network effect is key
* Early adopters get stake in the future of a project.
* PSS (Product - service - system), e.g. iphone - icloud - ios
* 5 states of organization:

* Disorganizations: volunteers, terrorists, etc..
* Hierarchical organizations have difficulties reacting quickly to problems.
	* Book: "Clockspeed": how quickly can your organization adapt/respond to changing market conditions?
* Cynefin model:
	* ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Cynefin_framework%2C_February_2011_%282%29.jpeg)
	* To operate in complex and chaotic, organizations have to be more self-organizing
	* How could blockchain enable separate functions of organizations to operate by self-organizing?
* Idea: design sprints as something that you could buy from a design consultancy? More designers -> more/better sprints?
* How do you programatically define design process so it could be in a smart contract?
	* How do you quantify the value?
	* Higher value for better participants?
